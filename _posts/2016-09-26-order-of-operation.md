Get a commit to push up<br />
How ever hyper your text <br />
Can be a bit vexing <br />
Sorting your log <br />
A foggy haze of commits <br />
Badly titled <br />

Entitlements reverted <br />
Near crisis averted <br />
*Italicized* or _emphasized_ <br />
Words mean little on bad color schemes <br />

Working tree clean, lean <br />
Far from clunky <br />
The origin is the master <br />
But it hasn't always been that way <br />

Operating remotely <br />
Possesive of your server <br />
Client targeting ferver <br />
Do you git merging? <br />

Eternal linux kernal <br />
Never forgets essential utensils <br />
Fork, spoon, and knife <br />
A heaping supper <br />
Of markdown and markup <br />

Repository story <br /> 
Infinite style <br /> 
Cascades of options <br />
Wardrobe saturated <br />
Still growing <br />
Parallel, the same circuitry <br /> 
As developer knowledge <br />

Bank out a clone <br />
Whose repo do you own? <br />
Pay interest, or not <br />
This space isn't square anymore <br />

Moving full circle <br />
Only squares use bad syntax <br />
Lax from lack of coding <br />
Slow servers on codeine <br />

Think creative maker space <br />
All irons in the fire <br />
Cloud nine or higher <br />
Branched to the rigourous buyer. <br />
