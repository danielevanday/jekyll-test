Get a commit to push up
How ever hyper your text 
Can be a bit vexing
Sorting your log
A foggy haze of commits
badly titled

Entitlements reverted
Near crisis averted
*Italicized* or _emphasized_
Words mean little on bad color schemes

Working tree clean, lean
Far from clunky
The origin is the master
But it hasn't always been that way

Operating remotely
Possesive of your server
Client targeting ferver
Do you git merging?

Eternal linux kernal 
Never forgets essential utensils
Fork, spoon, and knife
A heaping supper
Of markdown and markup

Repository story 
Infinite style 
Cascades of options
Wardrobe saturated 
Still growing
Parallel, the same circuitry 
As developer knowledge

Bank out a clone
Whose repo do you own?
Pay interest, or not
This space isn't square anymore

Moving full circle
Only squares use bad syntax
Lax from lack of coding 
Slow servers on codeine 

Think creative maker space 
All irons in the fire
Cloud nine or higher
Branched to the rigourous buyer.
